<li>
This is a very long list of suggestions for projects so that you have many choices.
You may also choose different projects  if you discuss with  Prof. Martin  IN ADVANCE.

<li>
Send project reports by email to Prof. Martin.  Please send to BOTH rmartin42@gmail.com
and rmartin@illinois.edu to be sure I get it.  You can also give  me a hard copy report if that
is best for you.

<li>
Each project should provide a description of the ideas  and/or methods and conclusions
on the results.   The project report should be at least one typed page (longer if there are equations
 of figures that take up space).

<li>
 Some projects are taken from the book "Electronic Structure" by R. Martin.
For other projects you should give at least one source.


<blockquote>
<ol TYPE=I>
<ol TYPE=I>

<li>
Projects taken from the  book -- you may also use other references!

<ol TYPE=A>
<li>
Summarize any one of the chapters:  8, 11, or 13 through 23.
<li> You may choose Ch. 12, but then you must discuss in some detail parts that we did not do in class, for example, the use of empirical pseudopotentials.

<li> The ``2n+1'' theorem (not widely known) shows that if the wavefunction
is know to order $n$ in a perturbation expansion, the energy can be calculated
 to order 2n+1.  Work out the details of the formulas in the book and
 do exercise 3.24.

<li>
Work out the general form for ``special points'' to any order,  and work
Exercise 4.21.

<li>
Exercises 14.23-24.  This uses Harrison's tight-binding approach.

<li> Bands in nanotubes.  See description below.

<li>
Summarize the iterative methods in Appendix M and give a comparison
the approaches used in at least two methods.

<li> Exercise 3.12 and 3.16 in the book.  The first is very important for
understanding the exchange energy, but it only be stated in class.
The second is a very interesting feature of fermions and bosons.

<li> Give the expressions for Hartree-Fock approximation for bands
in a metal and work exercises 5.9, 10, 11 in the book.  These are important relations that
illustrate the basic features of bands in metals and the problem in
Hartree-Fock approximation.  The integrals are somewhat tedious and you do not need to
evaluate them in detail but you do need to show that they lead to a
unphysical singularity at the Fermi energy.


<li>
Describe the Green's function methods for calculation of phonon
dispersion in Ch. 19.  Contrast this with the "brute force" methods
that require large "supercells".

<li>
Describe two of the methods for constructing norm-conserving pseudopotentials.


<li>
Work out Exercise 4.22. for bands in a one-dimensional crystal.  This
shows relations among the methods.

<li>
Linear scaling "order N" methods. Summarize the general ideas and
discuss methods.  See Ch. 23..</li>

<li>
Theory of Atomic Sphere methods in solids.&nbsp; This is barely covered
in class.&nbsp; A project could go further to show the usefulness of atomic
sphere approximations to have simple calculations for solids.</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Theory of polarization in solids and Berry's phases.</font></li>

<li>Theory of Wannier Functions: history and recent advances</li>


</ol>


<li>
Bands in interesting systems</li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<li> Nanotubes.  Report on one paper that describes the types of nanotubes formed
by ``rolling'' graphene sheets to make tubes.  Give the conditions for metallic
tubes (with zero gap like graphene) or tubes with gaps.  A possible paper is
Hamada, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 6, 1579 (1992) or another paper.

<li>Bands for the copper oxide square lattices in the Hi-Tc superconductors.
Describe in  tight binding and discuss the way the second neighbor terms
affects the Fermi surface.  Show the results are different depending on
the sign of these terms.

</ol>

<li>
Physical Properties</li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<li>
Optical properties of materials.  Give theory in terms of transitions between bands
and discussion of results in cases with direct and indirect bands gaps.

<li>
Phonons.  Give theory in terms of forces and force constants and discuss
 comparison of theory and experiment for several cases.

<li>
Elastic properties.  Give theory in terms of  constants and discuss
 comparison of theory and experiment for several cases.

<li>
Magnetism.  Two possibilities: Give theory in terms of magnetic moments and
Weiss mean field theory, or in terms of Kohn-Sham calculations. In either
case discuss magnetism in at least two materials.

<li>
Report on various calculations of surface energies that have been reported.
Give at lest 3 references (not in the book) with description of their
conclusions.

</ol>

<li>
Density Functional Theory</li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<li>
Describe the original derivation of the PBE functional (very nice arguments and
construction) and give the form proposed.

<li>
Theory and actual recent examples of GGAs </li>

<li>
Hybrid functionals.  What are they?  In what ways have they been used?
  </li>

<li>
Theory of van der Waals functional proposed in a recent papers and following ones</li>

<li>
Applications of the van der Waals functional, what are tested that have been done
 and uses for interesting problems.  </li>

</ol>
