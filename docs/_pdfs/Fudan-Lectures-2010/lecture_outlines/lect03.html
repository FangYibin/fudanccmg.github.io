<p> Reading:  Text: Chapters 6,7.

<p>What is so important about DFT that it led to the 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Walter Kohn?&nbsp; Why did it happen in 1998? Why in Chemistry?&nbsp;

<p>DFT is by far the main method used for realistic calculations in solids.&nbsp; Under what circumstances does it appear to be successful?&nbsp; When are present approximations not successful?&nbsp; This lecture and the next are devoted to the theory and description of some typical results.

<font color="#000000">These are exact theorems that ALL properties of electron systems are functionals of the density</font></li>

<li>

<font color="#000000">Holds the promise of solving many-electron problems
WITHOUT dealing with the full many-body wave-function</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">But no hint of how to accomplish this! Must still solve the many-body problem to find the functional</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Analogy with P-V relation of a classical liquid - Legendre transformation between V and P as independent variables </font></li>

</ol>

<li>
<font color="#000000">What are reasons that transforming to
in terms of density instead` of potential? </font></li>

<ol TYPE=A>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The hard parts to calculate are effects of
 correlation among the electrons.  This is intrinsically a
 function of density (how far apart the the electrons are). It is only an indirect functional of the potential.</font></li>

</ol>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Kohn-Sham Auxiliary system</font></li>

<ol TYPE=A>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The H-K theorems  expressions in terms of many-body expectation values, but is this useful?</font></li>


<li>
<font color="#000000">Exact expressions in terms of many-body expectation values, but is this useful?</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Replace interacting-electron problem with non-interacting particle problem</font></li>


<li>
<font color="#000000">Require the density be the same as interacting-electron
system (not proven in general that this is possible)</font></li>



<li>

<font color="#000000">Leads to density and ground state energy of the interacting-electron

system by solving appropriate non-interacting particle equations called the Kohn-Sham equations</font></li>



<li>

<font color="#000000">NO other properties are guaranteed to be given correctly

by solution of Kohn-Sham equations</font></li>

</ol>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Force`and Stress are also given
exactly in principle.  They are ground state properties
given by the "force theorem" ("Helmann-Feynman theorem",
even though a small displacement of an atom can be expressed in
terms of perturbation theory involving excitations.
Similarly for the "stress theorem"
</font></li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<li>
<font color="#000000">This is valid in an interacting particle system. It is independent of the HK theorem, but the analogy can be instructive.
