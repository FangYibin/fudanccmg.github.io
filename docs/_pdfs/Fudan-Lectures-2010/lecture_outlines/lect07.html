Because they are much faster than traditional methods, they have made possible entirely new advances in calculations of properties of materials.<br>In traditional methods the wavefunctions are expanded in a basis set of size N<sub>B</sub>, leading to ahamiltonian matrix of size N<sub>B</sub> x N<sub>B</sub>. Finding the eigenvectors with a standard diagonalizationroutine such as LAPACK requires a number of operations proportional to N<sub>B</sub><sup>3</sup>.  In addition, solution of the self-consistent Kohn-Sham equations involves repeated updating of the hamiltonian and diagonalizations.Iterative methods recast the problem as a minimization procedure, which can often be viewed as either the embodiment of physical principles or as the adaptation of powerful numerical techniques.<br>  The result is that methods such as plane waves can often be extremely efficient even for very large problems.<p>Iterative methods are particularly important for plane wave and uniform grid methods which are examples of the <I>&quot;keep it simple&quot;</I> approach. All matrix elements are easy to calculate, but the penalty to be paid is that many plane-waves or grid pointsare necessary for the accurate representation of the wavefunctions.Iterative methods allow us to handle the large basis sets or grids in an efficient manner.</p><P>Important reference for numerical methods: Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling,Flannery, <I>Numerical Recipes (in C, Fortran,...).</I> <BR>Review Article: M.
